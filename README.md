# 1 .Introduction:-
The OrangeHRM  website serves as a platform for users to explore and evaluate the features of the OrangeHRM software, an open-source Human Resource Management (HRM) solution. It is designed to streamline HR processes and provides tools for managing employee data, leave requests, time tracking, recruitment, and performance evaluations.


# 2.Test Objective:-
●	State the goals of the testing process (e.g., validate functionality, performance, Usability).
●	Specify the expected outcomes.
# 3.Testing Scope:-
       The scope of this test plan includes:
1.	Authentication (Login/Logout).
2.	Navigation through the dashboard and various modules.
3.	Employee Management functionalities.
4.	Leave Management workflows.
5.	Recruitment processes.
6.	Performance evaluation module.
7.	UI/UX and browser compatibility testing.
8.	Security testing (basic checks).
9.	Performance testing.
# 4. Test Schedule Duration:
 ● TestPlanning Phase: 48 Hours

# 5. Test Coverage: -
The test coverage will include functional, non-functional, and security, performance & compatibility testing across the features to be tested.
 Functional Testing:
 1. Login/Registration: Test user sign-up, login, and profile updates. 
2. MenuDisplay and Search: Ensure menus display correctly and searches return accurate results. 
3.OrderPlacement: Verify that users can add items, update quantities, and place orders.
